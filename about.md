I am a Research Associate in Radio Astronomy and Open Science Champion at the Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics, University of Manchester, UK. I observe jets from young stars with next-generation radio telescopes to investigate the physical processes that assemble stars like our Sun. I am an Open Project Lead in the Round 4 Cohort of Mozilla Open Leaders ([#RebelFoxes](https://twitter.com/rachaelevelyn/lists/rebelfoxes)🦊), working on a project to develop an open science how-to kit for astronomers to open up their research workflow from proposal to publication. I also organize a chapter of HER+Data in Manchester ([@herplusdatamcr](https://twitter.com/herplusdatamcr)), a meetup group to bring together women who work with and love data - to support one another, inspire each other, share experiences and talk data. HER+Data MCR allows me to bridge the gap between academia and industry by connecting women across STEM fields. I am interested in community building and engagement, promoting openness, inclusivity and well-being in academia/tech.
