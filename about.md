<p align="justify">I was most recently employed as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies (DIAS) to investigate the radio emission properties of outflows from young, Sun-like stars at very long wavelengths, specifically with the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR). Our team was the first to successfully detect a young stellar object (YSO) with LOFAR, extending the spectral energy distibution for a T Tauri star to 2 metres (150 MHz) and constraining physical properties associated with its plasma outflows. </p>
<p align="justify">I pioneered these studies of YSOs at metre wavelengths using the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) during my PhD, which I conducted at DIAS with Prof. Tom Ray (DIAS) and Dr. Anna Scaife (University of Manchester). My thesis, entitled <i>Morphology and Time Evolution of Thermal Jets Associated with Low Mass Young Stars</i> (as it was meant to comprise the reduction and analysis of data from the e-MERLIN Legacy Programme with the same name), presents multi-scale, multi-frequency radio properties of low mass protostellar systems. I led three projects performing systematic, quantitative analyses of data from three world-class radio interferometers: the Arcminute Microkelvin Imager (AMI), the expanded Multi-Element Radio Linked Interferometer Network (e-MERLIN) and the GMRT. </p>
<p align="justify">I obtained my B.Sc. in Physics at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville where I contributed to projects related to the explosion mechanism of Type Ia Supernovae using the supercomputing facilities at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). In this role my responsibilities were to script pipelines to process data and visualise the data generated by the team. I also interned at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in 2008 as part of the NASA Undergraduate Student Research Program. My project was to develop a procedure for cleaning and analysing near-infrared echelle spectroscopic data, which I applied to a sample of preplanetary nebulae to look for the signatures of high-velocity outflows that shape the resulting planetary nebula, and a sample of stellar interlopers: young stars with winds speeding through and interacting with dense interstellar clouds. </p>
