I am a Research Associate in Radio Astronomy and Open Science Champion at the Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics, University of Manchester, UK. I observe jets from young stars with next-generation radio telescopes to investigate the physical processes that assemble stars like our Sun. I am a Mozilla Open Leader (Round 4 Open Project Lead, Round 5 Mentor and Cohort A Host), fueling the Internet health movement through training, mentorship & working open best practices. I also organize a chapter of HER+Data in Manchester ([@herplusdatamcr](https://twitter.com/herplusdatamcr)), a meetup group to bring together women who work with and love data - to support one another, inspire each other, share experiences and talk data. HER+Data MCR allows me to bridge the gap between academia and industry by connecting women across STEM fields. I am interested in community building and engagement, promoting openness, inclusivity and well-being in science and technology.
